1. Unpack the First Huffman record offset (record number)
2. Load the huffman table
    - Fetch two 4 byte offset lengths, right after the HUFF header
    - At offset 1, read 256 4 byte integers, map each int over "Build dict1"
    - Build dict 1:
        Get code length (huff code len), term, maxcode (byte & 0x1F, byte & 0x70, byte >> 8) 
    - At offset 2, read 64 4 byte integers
        - Get the mincode (dict):
            - First 3 values, (value << (32 - i)) 
        - Get the maxcode (dict):
            - Values 1, 2 ((value + 1) << (32 - i) - 1)

3. For each huff record (from Huffman Record Count), run the record through CDIC, adding to the dict
    - Check that the CDIC header is valid
    - At offset 8 (from start of CDIC header), get number of phrases, number of phrases per record (power of 2)
    - Calculate the number of phrases for this record, either the max phrase length per record, or remaining phrase count
        (min max-phrases, (- (count dict) number-of-phrases))
    - Get the slice
        - Number of bytes in the slice: offset + 16 bytes (16 bytes = total header length)
        - Range slice the bytes from [18 + offset:18 + offset + (Number of bytes & 0x7FFF)]
        - Return the slice and whether the top bit of the number of bytes in the slice is set (blen & 0x8000)
    - For the number of phrases in this record, Get the slice of each and add it to the dictionary

3. Unpack
    - Total bits to read = (* 8 (count data))
    - While there are still bits to read (bitsleft - bitsread) > 0:
    	- Read a 4 byte integer (64 bits in length) into x
	- Read the n (starts at 32) bits from x into code
	- Using the first 8 bits of code, lookup the codelen, term, maxcode in dict 1
	- If term == 0
		- Increment codelen 1, seeking that offset forward in mincode (which sorts descending) until we hit a length less than code
		- Set maxcode using our codelen looked up in the maxcode dict
    	- Decrement n, bitsleft by codelen
	- Lookup index for CDIC dictionary (r) found by reading (codelen) bits from (- maxcode code)
	- Slice, flag looked up in CDIC dictionary
	- If flag == 0
		- Run the slice through unpack again recursively, setting the CDIC dictionary at (r) index to returned value
	- Else
		- Add the slice to the string
		
	- Return the final string
