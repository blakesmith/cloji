PalmDoc
PalmDoc combines LZ77 with a simple kind of byte pair compression. PalmDoc Algorithm: [10]
PalmDoc files are decoded as follows:
Read a byte from the compressed stream. If the byte is
	- 0x00: "1 literal" copy that byte unmodified to the decompressed stream.
	- 0x09 to 0x7f: "1 literal" copy that byte unmodified to the decompressed stream.
	- 0x01 to 0x08: "literals": the byte is interpreted as a count from 1 to 8, and that many literals are copied unmodified from the compressed stream to the decompressed stream.
	- 0x80 to 0xbf: "length, distance" pair: the 2 leftmost bits of this byte ('10') are discarded, and the following 6 bits are combined with the 8 bits of the next byte to make a 14 bit "distance, length" item. Those 14 bits are broken into 11 bits of distance backwards from the current location in the uncompressed text, and 3 bits of length to copy from that point (copying n+3 bytes, 3 to 10 bytes).
	- 0xc0 to 0xff: "byte pair": this byte is decoded into 2 characters: a space character, and a letter formed from this byte XORed with 0x80.

Repeat from the beginning until there is no more bytes in the compressed file.
