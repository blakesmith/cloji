<h2>From ASCII Coding to Huffman Coding</h2>
</a>

<p>
Many programming languages use ASCII coding for characters (ASCII stands
for American Standard Code for Information Interchange).  Some recent
languages, e.g., Java, use UNICODE which, because it can encode a bigger
set of characters, is more useful for languages like Japanese and
Chinese which have a larger set of characters than are used in English.
</p>

<p>
We'll use ASCII encoding of characters as an example.  In ASCII, every
character is encoded with the same number of bits: 8 bits per character.
Since there are 256 different values that can be encoded with 8 bits,
there are potentially 256 different characters in the ASCII character
set.  The common characters, e.g., alphanumeric characters, punctuation,
control characters, etc., use only 7 bits; there are 128 different
characters that can be encoded with 7 bits.  In C++ for example, the
type <em>char</em> is divided into subtypes unsigned-char and (the
default signed) char.  As we'll see, Huffman coding compresses data by
using fewer bits to encode more frequently occurring characters so that
not all characters are encoded with 8 bits. In Java there are no
unsigned types and <em>char</em> values use 16 bits (Unicode compared to
ASCII). Substantial compression results regardless of the
character-encoding used by a language or platform.
</p>

<h3>A Simple Coding Example</h3>

<p>
We'll look at how the string "go go gophers" is encoded in ASCII, how we
might save bits using a simpler coding scheme, and how Huffman coding is
used to compress the data resulting in still more savings.
</p>

<p>
With an ASCII encoding (8 bits per character) the 13 character string
"go go gophers" requires 104 bits. The table below on the left shows how
the coding works.

<p>

The string "go go gophers" would be written (coded numerically) as 103
111 32 103 111 32 103 111 112 104 101 114 115. Although not easily
readable by humans, this would be written as the following
stream of bits (the spaces would not be written, just the 0's and 1's)
</p>
<p>
<font size="-1">
1100111 1101111 1100000 1100111 1101111 1000000 1100111 1101111 1110000
1101000 1100101 1110010 1110011
</font>
</p>

<p>Since there are only eight different characters in "go go gophers",
it's possible to use only 3 bits to encode the different characters.  We
might, for example, use the encoding in the table on the right above,
though other 3-bit encodings are possible.
</p>

<a name="3bit">
<p>
Now the string "go go gophers" would be encoded as 0 1 7 0 1 7 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 or, as bits:
</p>
</a><p><a name="3bit">
<font size="-1">
000 001 111 000 001 111 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
</font>
</a>
</p>

<p>
By using three bits per character, the string "go go gophers" uses a
total of 39 bits instead of 104 bits.  More bits can be saved if we use
fewer than three bits to encode characters like g, o, and space that
occur frequently and more than three bits to encode characters like e,
p, h, r, and s that occur less frequently in "go go gophers".  This is
the basic idea behind Huffman coding: to use fewer bits for more
frequently occurring characters.  We'll see how this is done using a
tree that stores characters at the leaves, and whose root-to-leaf paths
provide the bit sequence used to encode the characters.
</p>

<h3>Towards a Coding Tree</h3>

<table align="CENTER">
<caption><strong>A tree view of the ASCII character set</strong></caption>
<tbody><tr><td width="55%">
<p>
Using a tree (actually a binary trie, more on that later) all characters
are stored at the leaves of a complete tree.  In the diagram to the
right, the tree has eight levels meaning that the root-to-leaf path
always has seven edges.  A left-edge (black in the diagram) is numbered
0, a right-edge (blue in the diagram) is numbered 1.  The ASCII code for
any character/leaf is obtained by following the root-to-leaf path and
catening the 0's and 1's.  For example, the character 'a', which has
ASCII value 97 (1100001 in binary), is shown with root-to-leaf path of
<em>right-right-left-left-left-left-right</em>.
</p>

</td><td valign="TOP">
<img src="./huffman_files/asciitree.jpg" alt="*">

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The structure of the tree can be used to determine the coding of any
leaf by using the 0/1 edge convention described.  If we use a different
tree, we get a different coding.  As an example, the tree below on the
right yields the coding shown on the left.

<a name="gogoencode">
<p>
Using this coding, "go go gophers" is encoded (spaces wouldn't appear in
the bitstream) as:
</p>
</a>
<p>

10 11 001 10 11 001 10 11 0100 0101 0110 0111 000

</p>
<p>
This is a total of 37 bits, which saves two bits from the encoding in
which each of the 8 characters has a 3-bit encoding 
that is <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#3bit">shown above</a>!  The bits are saved by coding
frequently occurring characters like 'g' and 'o' with fewer bits (here
two bits) than characters that occur less frequently like 'p', 'h', 'e',
and 'r'.
</p>

<p>
The character-encoding induced by the tree can be used to decode a
stream of bits as well as encode a string into a stream of bits.  You 
can try to decode the following bitstream; the answer with an
explanation follows:
</p>

<p>
01010110011100100001000101011001110110001101101100000010101
011001110110
</p>

<p>
To decode the stream, start at the root of the encoding tree, and follow
a left-branch for a 0, a right branch for a 1.  When you reach a leaf,
write the character stored at the leaf, and start again at the top of
the tree.  To start, the bits are 010101100111.  This yields
<em>left-right-left-right</em> to the letter 'h', followed (starting
again at the root) with <em>left-right-right-left</em> to the letter
'e', followed by <em>left-right-right-right</em> to the letter 'r'.
Continuing until all the bits are processed yields

<h3>Prefix codes and Huffman Codes</h3>
<p>
When all characters are stored in leaves, and every interior/(non-leaf)
node has two children, the coding induced by the 0/1 convention outlined
above has what is called the <em>prefix property</em>: no bit-sequence
encoding of a character is the prefix of any other bit-sequence encoding.
This makes it possible to decode a bitstream using the coding
tree by following root-to-leaf paths.  The tree shown above for "go go
gophers" is an optimal tree: there are no other trees with the same
characters that use fewer bits to encode the string "go go gophers".
There are other trees that use 37 bits; for example you can simply swap
any sibling nodes and get a different encoding that uses the same number
of bits.  We need an algorithm for constructing an optimal tree which in
turn yields a minimal per-character encoding/compression.  This
algorithm is called Huffman coding, and was invented by D. Huffman in
1952.  It is an example of a greedy algorithm.
</p>

<h2> Huffman Coding </h2>

<p>
We'll use Huffman's algorithm to construct a tree that is used for data
compression.  In the <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#huffcode">previous section</a> we saw
examples of how a stream of bits can be generated from an encoding,
e.g., how <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#gogoencode">"go go gophers" was written as 
1011001101100110110100010101100111000.</a>  We also saw how the tree can
be used to decode a stream of bits.  We'll discuss how to construct the
tree here.
</p>

<p>
We'll assume that each character has an associated weight equal to the
number of times the character occurs in a file, for example.  In the "go
go gophers" example, the characters 'g' and 'o' have weight 3, the space
has weight 2, and the other characters have weight 1.  When compressing
a file we'll need to calculate these weights, we'll ignore this step for
now and assume that all character weights have been calculated.
Huffman's algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a
group (or forest) of trees.  Initially, all the trees have a single node
with a character and the character's weight.  Trees are combined by
picking two trees, and making a new tree from the two trees.  This
decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees are
combined into one tree.  The algorithm is as follows:
</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<p>
</p><li> Begin with a forest of trees.  All trees are one node, with the
weight of the tree equal to the weight of the character in the node.
Characters that occur most frequently have the highest weights.
Characters that occur least frequently have the smallest weights.
<p>

</p><p>
</p></li><li> <p>Repeat this step until there is only one tree:</p>
Choose two trees with the smallest weights, call these trees
T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.  Create a new tree whose root has a
weight equal to the sum of the weights T<sub>1</sub> + T<sub>2</sub> and
whose left subtree is T<sub>1</sub> and whose right subtree is
T<sub>2</sub>.
<p></p>

</li><li> The single tree left after the previous step is an optimal encoding tree.
</li></ol>
<p></p>

<a name="forest"><p>
</p><p>
We'll use the string "go go gophers" as an example.  Initially we have
the forest shown below.  The nodes are shown with a weight/count that
represents the number of times the node's character occurs.
</p>


<center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher1.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>
</a>

<p>
We pick two minimal nodes.  There are five nodes with the minimal weight
of one, it doesn't matter which two we pick.  In a program, the
deterministic aspects of the program will dictate which two are chosen,
e.g., the first two in an array, or the elements returned by a priority
queue implementation.  We create a new tree whose root is weighted by
the sum of the weights chosen.  We now have a forest of seven trees as
shown here:
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher2.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
Choosing two minimal trees yields another tree with weight two as shown
below.  There are now six trees in the forest of trees that will
eventually build an encoding tree.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher3.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
Again we must choose the two trees of minimal weight.  The lowest weight
is the 'e'-node/tree with weight equal to one.  There are three trees
with weight two, we can choose any of these to create a new tree whose
weight will be three.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher4.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
Now there are two trees with weight equal to two.  These are joined into
a new tree whose weight is four.  There are four trees left, one whose
weight is four and three with a weight of three.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher5.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
Two minimal (three weight) trees are joined into a tree whose weight is
six.  In the diagram below we choose the 'g' and 'o' trees (we could
have chosen the 'g' tree and the space-'e' tree or the 'o' tree and the
space-'e' tree.)  There are three trees left.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher6.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
The minimal trees have weights of three and four, these are joined into
a tree whose weight is seven leaving two trees.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher7.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, the last two trees are joined into a final tree whose weight is
thirteen, the sum of the two weights six and seven.  Note that this tree
is different from the <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#hufftree">tree we used to illustrate
Huffman coding above</a>, and the bit patterns for each character are
different, but the total number of bits used to encode "go go gophers"
is the same.
</p>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="./huffman_files/gopher8.jpg" alt="*">
</center>
<p></p>
<p>

</p><p>
The character encoding induced by the last tree is shown below where
again, 0 is used for left edges and 1 for right edges.

<p>
The string "go go gophers" would be encoded as shown (with spaces used
for easier reading, the spaces wouldn't appear in the real encoding).
</p>

<p>
00 01 100 00 01 100 00 01 1110 1101 101 1111 1100
</p>

<p>
Once again, 37 bits are used to encode "go go gophers".  There
are several trees that yield an optimal 37-bit encoding of "go go
gophers".  The tree that actually results from a programmed
implementation of Huffman's algorithm will be the same each time the
program is run for the same weights (assuming no randomness is used in
creating the tree).
</p>

<h3>Why is Huffman Coding Greedy?</h3>

<p>
Huffman's algorithm is an example of a <strong>greedy
algorithm</strong>.
It's called greedy because the two smallest nodes are chosen at each
step, and this local decision results in a globally optimal encoding
tree.  In general, greedy algorithms use small-grained, or local
minimal/maximal choices to result in a global minimum/maximum.  Making
change using U.S. money is another example of a greedy algorithm.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Problem: give change in U.S. coins for any amount (say under $1.00)
using the minimal number of coins.
</p>

</li><li><p>Solution (assuming coin denominations of $0.25, $0.10, $0.05, and
$0.01, called quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, respectively): use
the highest-value coin that you can, and give as many of these as you
can.  Repeat the process until the correct change is given.</p>

</li><li><p>Example: make change for $0.91.  Use 3 quarters (the highest coin we
can use, and as many as we can use).  This leaves $0.16.  To make change
use a dime (leaving $0.06), a nickel (leaving $0.01), and a penny.  The
total change for $0.91 is three quarters, a dime, a nickel, and a
penny.  This is a total of six coins, it is not possible to make change
for $0.91 using fewer coins.
</p><p>
</p></li></ul>

<p>
The solution/algorithm is greedy because the largest denomination coin
is chosen to use at each step, and as many are used as possible.  This
locally optimal step leads to a globally optimal solution.  Note that
the algorithm <strong>does not work with different
denominations</strong>.  For example, if there are no nickels, the
algorithm will make change for $0.31 using one quarter and six pennies,
a total of seven coins.  However, it's possible to use three dimes and one
penny, a total of four coins.  This shows that greedy algorithms are not
always optimal algorithms.
</p>

<h2>Implementing/Programming Huffman Coding</h2>

<p>
In this section we'll see the basic programming steps in implementing
huffman coding.  More details can be found in the language specific
descriptions.
</p>

<p>
There are two parts to an implementation: a compression program and an
uncompression/decompression program.  You need both to have a useful
compression utility.  We'll assume these are separate programs, but they
share many classes, functions, modules, code or whatever
unit-of-programming you're using.  We'll call the program that reads a
regular file and produces a compressed file the <em>compression</em> or
<em>huffing</em> program.  The program that does the reverse, producing
a regular file from a compressed file, will be called the
<em>uncompression</em> or <em>unhuffing</em> program.
</p>

<h3>The Compression or Huffing Program</h3>

<p>
To compress a file (sequence of characters) you need a
<a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#codetable">table of bit encodings</a>, e.g., an
ASCII table, or a table giving a sequence of bits that's used to encode
each character.  This table is constructed from <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#hufftree">a
coding tree</a> using root-to-leaf paths to generate the bit sequence
that encodes each character.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
compressed file is made using the following top-level steps.  These
steps will be developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually
implement a program based on these ideas and sub-steps.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p>Build a table of per-character encodings.  The table may be given
to you, e.g., an ASCII table, or you may build the table from a Huffman
coding tree.</p>

</li><li> <p>Read the file to be compressed (the plain file) and process one
character at a time.  To process each character find the bit sequence
that encodes the character using the table built in the previous step
and write this bit sequence to the compressed file.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>
As an example, we'll use the table below on the left, which is generated
from the tree on the right.  Ignore the weights on the nodes, we'll use
those when we discuss how the tree is created.

<p>
To compress the string/file "streets are stone stars are not", we read
one character at a time and write the sequence of bits that encodes each
character.  To encode "streets are" we would write the following bits:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;     010011101111101101000110010111
</p>

<p>
The bits would be written in the order <em>010</em>, <em>011</em>,
<em>101</em>, <em>11</em>, <em>11</em>, <em>011</em>, <em>010</em>,
<em>001</em>, <em>100</em>, <em>101</em>, <em>11</em>.
</p>

<p>
That's the compression program.  Two things are missing from the
compressed file: (1) some information (called the header) must be written at
the beginning of the compressed file that will allow it to be
uncompressed; (2) some information must be written at the end of the file
that will be used by the uncompression program to tell when the
compressed bit sequence is over (this is the bit sequence for
the <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#pseudo-eof">pseudo-eof</a> character described later).
</p>

<h3>Building the Table for Compression/Huffing</h3>

<p>
To build a table of optimal per-character bit sequences you'll need to
build a Huffman coding tree using the greedy Huffman algorithm.  The
table is generated by following every root-to-leaf path and recording
the left/right 0/1 edges followed.  These paths make the optimal
encoding bit sequences for each character.
</p>

<p>
There are three steps in creating the table:
</p><ol>
<li><p>Count the number of times every character occurs.  Use these
counts to create an initial forest of one-node trees.  Each node has a
character and a weight equal to the number of times the character
occurs. An <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/#forest">example of one node trees</a> shows what the
initial forest looks like.</p>

</li><li><p>Use the greedy Huffman algorithm to build a single tree.  The
final tree will be used in the next step.</p>

</li><li><p>Follow every root-to-leaf path creating a table of bit sequence
encodings for every character/leaf.</p>
</li></ol>
<p></p>


<a name="header"><h3>Header Information</h3></a>

<p>
You must store some initial information in the compressed file that will
be used by the uncompression/unhuffing program.  Basically you must
store the tree used to compress the original file.  This tree is used by
the uncompression program.
</p>

<p>
There are several alternatives for storing the tree.  Some are outlined
here, you may explore others as part of the specifications of your
assignment.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Store the character counts at the beginning of the file.  You can
store counts for every character, or counts for the non-zero
characters.  If you do the latter, you must include some method for
indicating the character, e.g., store character/count pairs.
</p>
</li><li><p>
You could use a "standard" character frequency, e.g., for any English
language text you could assume weights/frequencies for every character
and use these in constructing the tree for both compression and
uncompression.  
</p>
</li><li><p> You can store the tree at the beginning of the file.  One method
for doing this is to do a pre-order traversal, writing each node
visited.  You must differentiate leaf nodes from internal/non-leaf
nodes.  One way to do this is write a single bit for each node, say 1
for leaf and 0 for non-leaf.  For leaf nodes, you will also need to
write the character stored.  For non-leaf nodes there's no information
that needs to be written, just the bit that indicates there's an
internal node.

When you write output the operating system typically buffers the output
for efficiency.  This means output is actually written to disk when some
internal buffer is full, not every time you write to a stream in a
program.  Operating systems also typically require that disk files 
have sizes that are multiples of some architecture/operating system
specific unit, e.g., a byte or word.  On many systems all file sizes are
multiples of 8 or 16 bits so that it isn't possible to have a 122 bit
file.  
<p>

In particular, it is not possible to write just one single bit to a
file, all output is actually done in "chunks", e.g., it might be done in
eight-bit chunks. In any case, when you write 3 bits, then 2 bits, then
10 bits, all the bits are eventually written, but you cannot be sure
precisely when they're written during the execution of your
program. Also, because of buffering, if all output is done in eight-bit
chunks and your program writes exactly 61 bits explicitly, then 3 extra
bits will be written so that the number of bits written is a multiple of
eight.  Your decompressing/unhuff program must have some mechanism to
account for these extra or "padding" bits since these bits do not
represent compressed information.
</p><p>

Your decompression/unhuff program cannot simply read bits until there
are no more left since your program might then read the extra padding bits
written due to buffering. This means that when reading a compressed
file, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> use code like this.
</p><xmp>
        int bits;
        while ((bits = input.readbits(1)) != -1)
        {
            // process bits
        }
</xmp>
To avoid this problem, you can use a pseudo-EOF character and write a
loop that stops when the pseudo-EOF character is read in (in compressed
form).  The code below illustrates how reading a compressed file
works using a pseudo-EOF character:
<xmp>
       int bits;
       while (true)
       {
           if ((bits = input.readbits(1)) == -1)
           {
               System.err.println("should not happen! trouble reading bits");
           }
           else
           { 
               // use the zero/one value of the bit read
               // to traverse Huffman coding tree
               // if a leaf is reached, decode the character and print UNLESS
               // the character is pseudo-EOF, then decompression done

               if ( (bits & 1) == 0) // read a 0, go left  in tree
               else                  // read a 1, go right in tree

               if (at leaf-node in tree)
               {
                   if (leaf-node stores pseudo-eof char) 
                       break;   // out of loop
                   else
                       write character stored in leaf-node
               }
           }
       }
</xmp>

When a compressed file is written the last bits written should be the
bits that correspond to the pseudo-EOF char. You will have to write
these bits explicitly. These bits will be recognized by the program
unhuff and used in the decompression process. This means that your
decompression program will never actually run out of bits if it's
processing a properly compressed file (you may need to think about this
to really believe it). In other words, when decompressing you will read
bits, traverse a tree, and eventually find a leaf-node representing some
character. When the pseudo-EOF leaf is found, the program can terminate
because all decompression is done. If reading a bit fails because there
are no more bits (the bit reading function returns false) the compressed
file is not well formed.
<p>

Every time a file is compressed the count of the the number of times the
pseudo-EOF character occurs should be one --- this should be done
explicitly in the code that determines frequency counts. In other words,
a pseudo-char EOF with number of occurrences (count) of 1 must be
explicitly created and used in creating the tree used for compression.
